# Pump-Track-IOT
Problem Statement:

In the face of escalating water scarcities, households are increasingly reliant on water pumps to fulfill their daily needs. However, the consistent and heavy usage of these pumps necessitates meticulous maintenance to ensure continuous functionality. Traditional maintenance approaches often fall short in addressing issues promptly, leading to inefficiencies and potential breakdowns. Consequently, there is a critical need for innovative solutions that streamline maintenance processes while enhancing operational efficiency.

Problem Objective :

The objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive water pump system that seamlessly collects, analyses, and stores real-time data pertaining to 1 phase motor performance. This system aims to enable proactive maintenance, optimize pump performance, and detect anomalies promptly. Furthermore, it seeks to provide user-friendly interfaces for visualization, analysis, and control, empowering users to make informed decisions regarding pump operations.
The project aims to develop an interactive water pump system to address challenges in households facing water scarcity. It will focus on real-time data collection, proactive maintenance, and user-friendly interfaces to optimize 1 phase motor performance. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency, extend pump lifespan, and promote sustainability in water management.
